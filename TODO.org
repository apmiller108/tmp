CLOSED: [2025-01-03 Fri 14:53]
  - [X] Show the title at the top in a fixed container.
  - [X] Show form on click of edit icon (hide field) and put focus on input
  - [X] Hide form and show field when input loses focus
  - [X] Extract partial
  - [X] On update, render turbo stream partial
  - [X] add title to conversaions table
  - [X] set title default based on first message
* TODO show meta data about the assistant response (model, present, temp, token count) [2/8]
  - [X] add response jsonb field to generate_text_requests
  - [X] update generate_text_request record with the full response.
    - This would be done in the GenerateTextJob
  - [ ] when displaying the turns, do so from the generate text requests
    associated to the conversation.
    - Conversations has an turns method that maps each message or response to a
      Conversation::Turn object. Update this method to map each
      generate_text_request, in order by created_at, prompt and response. Use
      the helper method for the prompt. Use helper method on the
      response.content. Wrap the json blob in a InovkeModelResponse obj.
  - [ ] Show info icon in the tray of the assistant response. On click, show the
    token usage and model used. A generic Field component with options to be copyable?
  - [ ] refactor the concept of an exchange from the conversation jsonb field to
    being constructed from the generate_text_requests. I think this is already
    done.
  - [ ] Migrate existing conversation exchange to the associated
    generate_text_requests objects. Stub the token counts and what not.
  - [ ] Remove code the updates the conversation. Drop the form object. Do we
    still need a separate controller for the memo conversations?
  - [ ] Drop the exchange column
