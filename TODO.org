CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 22:23]
  - [X] add response jsonb field to generate_text_requests
  - [X] update generate_text_request record with the full response.
    - This would be done in the GenerateTextJob
  - [X] when displaying the turns, do so from the generate text requests
    associated to the conversation.
    - Conversations has an turns method that maps each message or response to a
      Conversation::Turn object. Update this method to map each
      generate_text_request, in order by created_at, prompt and response. Use
      the helper method for the prompt. Use helper method on the
      response.content. Wrap the json blob in a InovkeModelResponse obj.
  - [X] refactor the concept of an exchange from the conversation jsonb field to
    being constructed from the generate_text_requests.
  - [X] Migrate existing conversation exchange to the associated
    generate_text_requests objects. Stub the token counts and what not.
  - [X] Remove code that updates the conversation from the conversations view.
  - [X] Can we remove the code that creates the conversation too? And ditch that
    form object?

      window.history.pushState('converstion', 'Edit Conversation', '/users/3/conversations/3/edit');

    conversation_turn_component to get the data from gtr. It will render both
    the user and assistant response
  - [X] Add the concept of pending_response to gtr. Use that to determine when
    to show the spinner
  - [X] Implement a to_message_turn method on gtr that will return a tuple of
    properly formatted user and assistant hashes that will be serialied for the
    http request
  - [X] For the exchange loop over the gtrs and call to_message_turn to produce
    the tuple of user, assistant response
  - [X] Delete the conversaion::turn objects
  - [X] Add enum to gtr (pending_response, complete, error)

    the component. Do this in a exhausted retries block
